# Stylify

Stylify is a lightweight CSS framework similar to Bootstrap but with no interactive elements powered by JavaScript. 
Stylify can be used to quickly prototype webpages and is designed in a way that helps you minimize the amount 
of classes needed to create the designs you want, so you can write a cleaner and shorter HTML than Bootstrap
would require.
