# Library repository

This is a repository where I host all my shared libraries from.
If you find an NPM package in one of my other projects which comes from
some `localhost` address (usually `http://verdaccio.localhost/`) and you cannot
find it in the public NPM registry, this package comes from here. Feel free
to download and use any of packages here to run my projects or even in your own ones.

Please note that licenses for each package can be found inside the package itself.
